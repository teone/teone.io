This is my personal website

This is absolutely nothing special, I won't waste more than one hour or so in doing this. I'm not a vip and I don't really need a website, but I also think I must have one.

Thanks to Daniel Ludin to have written and shared [Snabbt.js](https://github.com/daniel-lundin/snabbt.js) an awesome animation library.
